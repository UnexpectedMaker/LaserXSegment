# LaserXSegment Display Library
An API that lets you display numbers and letters on LaserXSegment RGB LED displays that are available from [tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/seonr/laser-segment-display/)

You can find the Open Source hardware PCB design and Gerber files here too as well as the DXF laser cut design files

## Installing and Use
The downloaded code should be added to your arduino IDE libraries folder, and the library requires the [Adafruit NeoPixel library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel) for it to function.

To include the LaserXSegment library in your project:

    #include <LaserXSegment.h>

You can then initialise the display with the following line that includes the number of Laser7Segment digits and the GPIO to control them:

    LaserXSegment disp( 5, 4 );

You then start the display with the bebin method, passing the brightness:

    disp.Begin(80);

The you simply pass the display the String you would like displayed and a color:

    disp.DisplayText( "1234", disp.Color( 255,0,0) );


Enjoy!
