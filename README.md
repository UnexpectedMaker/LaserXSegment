# LaserXSegment Display Library
An API that lets you display numbers and letters on LaserXSegment RGB LED displays that are available from [tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/seonr/laser-segment-display/)

You can find the Open Source hardware PCB design and Gerber files here too as well as the DXF laser cut design files

## Installing and Use
The downloaded code should be added to your arduino IDE libraries folder, and the library requires the [Adafruit NeoPixel library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel) for it to function.

To include the LaserXSegment library in your project:

    #include <LaserXSegment.h>

You can then initialise the display with the following line that includes the number of Laser7Segment digits and the GPIO to control them:

    LaserXSegment disp( 5, 4 );

You then start the display with the bebin method, passing the brightness:

    disp.Begin(80);

The you simply pass the display the String you would like displayed and a color:

    disp.DisplayText( "1234", disp.Color( 255,0,0) );


Enjoy!

I love making and designing projects but sharing open source projects takes a lot of thought and time. I do it because I think itâ€™s important to share knowledge and give back to the community like many have done before me.

If you find this project useful or want to see more open source projects like it, please consider buying me a coffee or backing me on Patreon to say thanks!
